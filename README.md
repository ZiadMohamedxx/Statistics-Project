# Statistics Project â€“ Data Visualization and Analysis Using Python

This project presents a full statistical analysis and data visualization process using Python. It was developed as part of the MTH204 Statistics course and follows the official project guidelines. The dataset was explored through graphs, statistical metrics, and visual insight, using Python libraries only.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to analyze key features in the dataset:

- âœ… **Correlation Matrix Plot**
- âœ… **Scatter Plot** between `BloodPressure` and `BMI`
- âœ… **Distribution Plots** for:
  - `Pregnancies`
  - `SkinThickness`
  - `Age`
- âœ… **Pie Chart** for:
  - `Outcome`
- âœ… **Boxplots** for:
  - `SkinThickness`
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
  - `BloodPressure`

Each visualization is saved as an image file and also appears in the notebook or exported HTML version.
